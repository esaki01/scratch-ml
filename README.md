# Implement code of machine learning from scratch

This is for understanding "black box" of machine learning.

## Details

We implement "numerical optimization problem", e.g. newton's method, gradient descent and lagrange multipliers method, etc. Also we implement "machine learning algorithm", e.g. k-NN, linear regression, neural network, PCA, etc.

## Rules 

We should not use scikit-learn which is a library for machine learning, except for loading datasets. However, it is OK to use NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, etc.

## Prerequisites

Please install the below libraries if not working.
```
pip install sklearn
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install keras
```
